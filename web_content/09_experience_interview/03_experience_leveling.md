## Experience Interview: Communicate Leveling

One of your interviewer’s goals is to suss out your leadership experience. The main way they do this is by extracting *scope* from your answers.

Suppose you are asked "tell me a time where you made a design decision that you later regretted?" Let's go over some possible answers.

**Answer**: I made this library, and it became highly coupled. **Scope**: You are communicating that you dealt with libraries — the scope of a new grad

**Answer**: I owned this part the project, and I under-estimated how long it would take. **Scope**: You are communicating that you dealt with features — the scope of an L4 engineer.

**Answer**: I owned this project, and made too many tradeoffs to launch — it took us much longer to get back to quality. **Scope**: You are communicating your leadership over a team — the scope of an L5 engineer.

**Answer**: I owned a suite of services, and spent so much time maintaining them, that I didn’t see we could re-architect it like this. **Scope**: You are communicating your leadership across the org — the scope of an L6 engineer

Again, the way this is parsed is indirect, so the key to communicating this signal is your homework in **Communication.** If you have a good sense of the leveling guide (and you did the exercises of writing up examples of what you did for your level as well as the one above it) the stories you tell will naturally communicate leveling.
