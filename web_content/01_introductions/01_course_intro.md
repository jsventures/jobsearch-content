Stepan: The knowledge from this course comes from our 100-day adventure, going on a job search as senior engineers. We went on a combined 20+ onsites.


Joe: We found out that, though there’s a lot of information about job searching, some of the most key concepts were missing. Things like, communicating your narrative, or communicating your level through system design


Stepan: We started sharing this with our friends, and began to notice real changes in their performance — we saw 30-100% compensation differences.


Joe: Our goal in this course is to give you the roadmap and the lessons you’ll need to complete a phenomenal job search.


Stepan: To use this course effectively, start with the study guide. There, you’ll learn how you can layer the content, to get the best out of the course.


Joe: Throughout most sections you’ll see homework. The homework is what’s going to truly make the difference.


Stepan: If you follow along, and truly give it an honest effort, you’ll come across more confident to recruiters, significantly improve your performance in the interview, and grow as an engineer.


Joe: We're here for you — if you have any feedback, please let us know.


Stepan: We put our heart into this, and we hope you love this course. Without further ado, check out the study guide, and start your journey!
