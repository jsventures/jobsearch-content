## Communicating Signal

Now you speak the language of scope & signal and you’ve formed a conviction about your level.

Now, it’s time to **calibrate.** Our goal here is to ensure the signal you convey matches the level you want. See the homework below.  As you go through the different interview types, you’ll refine more and more the kind of signal you want to send in each type. For now, let’s get the narrative and resume right.

Once you have formed your mental game and enriched your communication you're ready to start the interview process strong!

### Homework
* Review signal and scope, the [leveling guide](#leveling-guide), and your leveling homework.

* Update your narrative and resume with sentences that demonstrate your signal
