## Concluding

Congratulations for making it this far. Hopefully you feel some relief after signing the offer. It's been a long journey, and we hope you are excited about your next opportunity. Although your job search is done, we recommend you do a couple more things to conclude well.

### Inform other companies
If you had other offers, let your recruiters know. Email is fine, but letting them know over the phone is really classy.

### Update your community
Now that you've signed let your people know! They will be excited to hear the good news.

### Send thank-yous
You should send these to people you deeply connected with throughout the process. At a minimum we recommend you send a note to your future manager and teammates if you met them. They will be happy to hear that you joined.

### Send LinkedIn Requests
The valley is small, just because you turned down an offer doesn't mean you won't connect with a company or manager in the future. Throughout your job search you've met a lot of talented people. This is a great opportunity to expand your network. Who knows where you'll end up next.

After doing all this you've beautifully concluded the job search. Well done!
