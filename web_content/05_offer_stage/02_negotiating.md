In our opinion the best negotiations are short and concise. We recommend to do this over email. Ask yourself what package would make you sign immediately and send over those numbers to your recruiter. Your email could look something like this:

```
Hi Recruiter,

I'm ready to make my decision. The choice is between you and
competing offer. If we can get the following package I will be
ready to sign immediately.

Base: Number
Equity: Number
Signing Bonus: Number

I'm excited :)

Cheers,
Your Name
```

Your recruiter will most likely give some push-back. They may ask what are your competing offers. They may say they can't meet those expectations. Recruiters deal with lots of candidates and have significantly more negotiating experience than you. By negotiating over email you will be able to thoroughly think about your responses and not bring in your own emotions (negotiating is stressful!) This will significantly improve your odds of getting a better package. The following will also help your negotiations:

### Know your band
Do your research on the company and their ranges for your level. [Levels.fyi][negotiate-levels] is a good resource for this. If you have friends or mentors at the company, ask them as well. Get an idea of what is realistic and evaluate whether your target compensation is in band for your target level

### Have multiple offers
This is one of the strongest forms of leverage you have. If you have offers from other competitive companies you should certainly let your recruiter know. This will allow them to make a strong case to the compensation team to approve your package. Even if the other offers are lower they may bump up your package to close you

### Be willing to walk away
This can be very hard to do, but ultimately one of the most powerful things you can do for negotiations. It is also extreme and should be a last resort. Do not do this unless you are truly centered on walking away if your expectations are not met. Suppose you have an offer from your dream company which is lower than an offer from another good company. In this scenario dream company won't budge -- assume this is final. After factoring everything in, are you truly willing to walk away? If instead your expectations were met would you sign immediately? If you answered yes to both questions, let your recruiter know that you can't take the offer unless your package is bumped up. At this point feel free to hop on a call, since you're now centered on your decision you will be free from any fear. Your resolve will communicate strength. The ball is entirely in their court.

This strategy is not limited to just compensation. Suppose you were leveled lower at dream company vs good company but overall compensation was comparable (or even higher at dream company). However you evaluate that the expectations, responsibilities, and growth at good company would be higher. If those things are important enough to you, ask yourself whether you are willing to walk away from dream company. If so, let your recruiter know that without the higher level you cannot accept.

For more tips we recommend you loop up [pattio11's salary negotiation article][negotiate] as well as other negotiation resources. An hour or two of research could you net you an additional $100,000+ -- definitely worth your time!

### A word on exploding offers
This is an unfortunate tactic used to close a candidate and prey on their fear that the offer may fall through. Hiring good people is hard. The company has already heavily invested in you by having you go through their process. They will not rescind if you need more time. Be polite but firm with your recruiter about your needs and expectations.

Once you have negotiated a package that you are willing to sign, ask your recruiter to send over the offer. The offer letter will most likely have a deadline -- but this is reasonable since you are ready to sign immediately.

If you've made it this far and signed -- congratulations! An exciting new adventure awaits you. All that is left on your part is concluding / sharing the news with your community.
