## Choosing
After your onsites you may find yourself in the fortunate yet uncertain position of choosing between multiple companies. This can be a tough decision. Here are some tips we used to decide:

* Get centered. Go back to your narrative and ask yourself what is most important to you. What are your goals? How does each company fit with your desired path.
* Meet your team. If you haven't already, meet your prospective manager. Ask your recruiter to set up in-person or phone meetings. Your manager has a huge impact on your experience at work. Feel them out, ask yourself if they are the right manager for you. Similarly, if you haven't met other engineers on the team, set up meetings to chat with them about work. Don't be shy about setting up multiple meetings. We visited our top choices several times post-onsite before making our final decision. If they've extended an offer, the company wants you. Take your time in figuring out what is best for you
* Reach out to your community. Bounce your thoughts off your family, friends, and mentors. They may illuminate something you didn't see before. If multiple people are saying the same thing, there may be something to it. That said, if everyone says you should choose company A but in your heart you know you should choose company B -- the simple process of talking out loud with people you love and respect will provide clarity.
* Create a choosing document. After going through the above, create a document where you summarize all pros, cons, and thoughts. Writing things down will force you to synthesize everything and determine why a company is right for you.

This may seem like a lot of extra work. In some ways it is. There is no need to do the above if the choice is already clear to you. However, if you are unsure, take your time -- it's worth it.
