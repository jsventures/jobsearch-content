### W2-3: Recruiter Screens, Start Preparing for Technical Screens
- Watch and complete the homework for **Recruiter Screens**
- Watch and complete the homework for the relevant technical screens interviews. (Algo, and UI if you are a UI engineer)

### W7-8: Technical screens, system design prep

- Keep focused, keep fed, and eyes on the prize

At this point, you’ll be very busy with onsites, so no homework. Keep a log of every onsite you do, and lessons learned. If you are struggling or are uncertain of anything refer to the right section, or reach out to us.
