## Communication Introduction
What do you think your goal is when talking to a recruiter? In our experience, most people spend very little time thinking about this. Some will say it’s just a "performance" — they feel like they’re going through the motions

From our video on attitude, you can get the idea of the self-fulfilling prophecy this will start — it’s hard to get good at something that has no meaning.

However, the most common answer is this -- "I try to be myself."

With the recruiter, they will talk to them as a friend, and let them lead the conversation where it goes.

Now, this is on the right track. Being yourself is good — actually, it’s critical — if you pretend, it’ll come through, and at the end of the day, you want to work a place where they want to work with *you.*

However, there’s a BIG misconception here —

The misconceptions it that *being you* is actually coming through to the interviewer.

What if we told you, that when you thought you were being yourself, you were not actually understood?

It would be like, if you flew to Beijing and tried to strike up a conversation. You could be speaking, but no one would understand a thing you’re saying! — they don’t speak your language.

There is a *language* in the interview process, and a *purpose* behind what recruiters and interviews are trying to do. You *can* be yourself, but if you don’t know this language, you lose the ability to communicate. In some cases, you may be communicating the *opposite* of what you think you are.

In this module, we’ll learn this language. This is the language of signal, scope, and leveling. Once you learn this, you’ll see every single interaction in the job search differently — you’ll know the purpose, and have the tools to communicate *exactly* what makes you a phenomenal candidate, in each step of the process.

Are we ready? Let’s get into this.
